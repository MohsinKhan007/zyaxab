# Zyax AB Frontend Programming Challenge

This is the description of the project made by Author (Muhammad Mohsin) by attempting the coding test of Zyax AB

## How to run:

- Download the git repo by git clone or downloading it as a zip
- Extract the files and go it the directory
- Run command ` **npm start** `
- The project will run on port 3000

### Test cases:

- Run command ` **npm run test** `
- The written test cases will start running

## Features:

- Ant design is used in the project. As I already familiar with front-end framework: - react-bootstrap and MUI, I wanted to try the layout of Ant design.
- It has a Login Form Component which contains the logic of the application
- A Layout component which wraps the Layout component for layout styling
- A Login Component to the screen when user logs into the system
- It has utility folder which handles the loading, alert, API endpoint and cookies and local storage features.

## Working Description:

### Parts that was easy:

1. **The Layout of the project** : As I worked as a Full-Stack Developer, developing the layout styles was easy
2. **Form Validations** : experience was easy (did through alert Message generation as it was open to do and button disable didn't feel good for users)
3. **Cookie session:** Did handle many session of cookies
4. **State management:** Experience with React
5. **Test cases of the project:** Worked in TDD in 2 modules in last company

### Parts that was difficult:

1. **Write Test of Logout for deleting the cookies** : I have developed the test case which fires the function that deletes the cookies but it is not updated in our application. I intended to complete it by testing if the Login Form component is re-rendered The test case is now removed.
